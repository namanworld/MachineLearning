This assignment builds a logistic regression model to predict the possibility of whether a student will 
get admitted into a university. The training dataset contains historical data from previous applicants. 
For each training example,the applicant’s scores on two exams are the input labels and the admission decision 
is the output label. Based on this data, a classification model is built that estimates an applicant’s probability 
of admission based the scores from those two exams.
